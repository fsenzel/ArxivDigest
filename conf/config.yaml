# For physics topics, use the specific subtopics, e.g. "Astrophysics"
topic: "Nuclear Theory"
# An empty list here will include all categories in a topic
# Use the natural language names of the topics, found here: https://arxiv.org
# Including more categories will result in more calls to the large language model
categories: []

# Relevance score threshold. abstracts that receive a score less than this from the large language model

# Must be within 1-10
threshold: 6

# A natural language statement that the large language model will use to judge which papers are relevant 
#
# For example:
#     "I am interested in complexity theory papers that establish upper bounds"
#     "gas chromatography, mass spectrometry"
#     "making lots of money"

# This can be empty, which just return a full list of papers with no judgement or filtering,
# in whatever order arXiv responds with.

  1. I'm interested in energy and momentum loss of high energy jets in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, which is also called jet quenching.
  2. I would like to keep track with new insights and development within ultra-relativistic heavy-ion physics.
